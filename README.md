# Star-chart
A simple program which loads stars, planets, and messier objects from a table and displays them on a polar grid.
![example pic 1](https://github.com/Chase-Horton/Star-chart/blob/main/space2%20example)
Stars can be filtered by magnitude (brightness) to adjust to any sky and constellations can be shown or added.
(all stars will appear the same size to the human eye and the relative sizes in the charts represent brightness generated by the magnitude value in the hip dataset)

Also a telescope feature to simulate zooming in on a star.
